        <h1>A Brief Overview of FFXIV's History</h1>
            <p>
                <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></b> is a now critically acclaimed MMORPG developed and released by Square Enix in September of 2010. Upon launch, the game was heavily criticized by game journalists and players alike, citing heavy performance issues (even on high end machines), lethargic and uninspired gameplay, and a near endless stream of network issues and glitches. Square Enix realized quickly that the 2010 release of the game was not only not financially feasible to maintain, but also too unsteady of a foundation to build another game off of. This led to them enlisting the help of video game director and producer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoki_Yoshida" target="_blank">Naoki Yoshida</a> (known affectionately as Yoshi-P by the game's community). Yoshida requested that the game be shut down entirely, and began the process of completely remaking FFXIV from the ground up with his team. The game re-released on both PS3 and Windows in August 2013, now under the name <b><i>Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn</i></b>. Not only did the game recieve immense praise upon launch for both gameplay and narrative improvements, but it has also grown to be the single most profitable Final Fantasy game ever produced. Upon the release of the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/" target="_blank">Dawntrail expansion</a> in July 2024, the game now has over 33,000,000 active player accounts and continues to grow with every new patch.

        <h2>General Gameplay Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Players of FFXIV are truly spoiled for choice when it comes to the sheer amount and variety of content at their disposal, but the core gameplay loop still remains concise and simple. Players choose between one of 10 starting combat jobs (that number later growing to 21 in later content) and are cut loose to progress through the story, level their characters, enter dungeons and trials with friends, and get involved in any number of side activities the game has to offer. 
                Said side content includes, but is not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Ocean fishing trips that depart every 2 hours</li>
                <li>Competetive mahjong tournaments</li>
                <li>A dedicated RTS game within FFXIV that uses the player's minions</li>
                <li>Material crafting and gathering</li>
                <li>An entirely player-run item market system</li>
                <li>Player run housing districts and house customization</li>
                <li>Multiple Player v.s. Player combat modes</li>
            </ul>
        
            
           All in all, FFXIV truly presents itself as a game with something for everyone, and an award winning community to welcome any and all who wish to explore the world of Eorzea. </p>

        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>FFXIV's community is truly a diamond in the rough when compared to other MMORPGs. Players regularly band together to help out newcomers, hold charity events, and try their hardest to keep the game a welcome place for all. During the fallout of a series of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, an in-game Bard group toured around multiple game worlds to do live performances and raise funds for those affected. On their first night alone, they recieved over $3000 in donations from fellow players, bringing the community together and spreading awareness about the disaster to players all around the world. </p>
